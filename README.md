BioProgram

BioProgram is designed to do basic analysis of DNA sequences. It allows the user to upload DNA sequences in FASTA format and then analysed in the following ways:
- Find out the sequence length
- Calculate the percentage of bases which are a G or a C
- Compare two sequences to check whether they match
- Search Pubmed
- Calculate the complementary sequence
- Translate the sequence into its amino acids
Results are either displayed in a pop-up window, or written to file.

In order to run, BioProgram requires installation of Python3, GTK3 and Biopython.
